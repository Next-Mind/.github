## 1. Introduction

Mental health in educational environments has become a topic of high social and academic relevance, particularly after the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social isolation, abrupt changes in teaching models, and increased emotional pressures exposed weaknesses in the psychological support offered to students.

At the Technical School of Limeira (COTIL), there was no integrated technological structure to enable continuous monitoring of students’ mental health, nor efficient communication between students, psychology professionals, and institutional administration.

NextMind was conceived as a comprehensive **multiplatform technological solution**, developed as part of an Integrative Project, aiming to fill this institutional gap.

---

## 2. Justification

The project is justified by the need to provide effective mental health support mechanisms in the school environment using accessible, organized, and secure digital tools.

The absence of specialized platforms hinders both the systematic monitoring of students and the integrated work of professionals, making the development of a centralized system essential.
